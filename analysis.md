The file above defines the implementation of the IOThread and IOThreadPool classes, which are used to manage and distribute the I/O operations of the TCP connections in the TinyRPC framework. The IOThread class represents a single I/O thread that runs a Reactor event loop and handles the I/O events of the TCP connections registered to it. The IOThreadPool class manages a pool of IOThread objects and provides methods to distribute I/O operations and coroutines to them. The code also includes some utility functions to get the current IOThread and semaphore objects used for thread synchronization.

Usage Explanation:
io_thread.h - IOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class. It initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and creates a new thread using pthread_create() function. The new thread executes the main() function of the IOThread class, passing the current object as a parameter.

After creating the new thread, the constructor waits for the new thread to finish executing the main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore semaphore. This semaphore is initially set to 0, so the call to sem_wait() blocks until the new thread signals it by calling sem_post() on the same semaphore. Once the semaphore is signaled, the constructor destroys the m_init_semaphore semaphore and returns.

In summary, the IOThread() method is used to create a new thread and wait for it to finish initializing before returning.

io_thread.h - ~IOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class, which initializes the m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore semaphores, creates a new thread using pthread_create(), and waits for the new thread to finish executing the main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore semaphore. Once the new thread has finished executing main(), it signals the m_init_semaphore semaphore using sem_post(), allowing the constructor to continue executing and eventually destroy the m_init_semaphore semaphore using sem_destroy().

The ~IOThread() method is the destructor of the IOThread class, which is called when an IOThread object is destroyed. It does not directly use the IOThread() method, but it may indirectly use it if an IOThread object is created and destroyed within the scope of a function. In that case, the IOThread() method would be called to create the new thread, and the ~IOThread() method would be called to destroy the thread and any associated resources.

io_thread.h - getIOThread()
The getIOThread() method returns a pointer to an instance of the IOThread class. When the IOThread() constructor is called, it initializes two semaphores, creates a new thread using pthread_create(), and waits for the new thread to finish executing the IOThread::main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore. Once the new thread has finished executing IOThread::main(), it signals the m_init_semaphore using sem_post(), allowing the constructor to continue executing and eventually return the newly created IOThread instance. The m_init_semaphore is then destroyed using sem_destroy().

io_thread.h - GetCurrentIOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class. When a new IOThread object is created, it initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and creates a new thread using pthread_create() function. The new thread executes the static method IOThread::main() with the current IOThread object as its argument.

After creating the new thread, the constructor waits for the new thread to finish executing IOThread::main() method by calling sem_wait() function on m_init_semaphore. This semaphore is signaled by the new thread when it finishes executing IOThread::main() method. Once the semaphore is signaled, the constructor destroys the m_init_semaphore and returns.

The GetCurrentIOThread() method is a static method that returns a pointer to the current IOThread object. It does not create a new IOThread object, but instead, it returns the IOThread object associated with the current thread. This is achieved by calling pthread_getspecific() function with a key that is unique to the IOThread class. If the IOThread object is not yet associated with the current thread, GetCurrentIOThread() creates a new IOThread object and associates it with the current thread using pthread_setspecific() function.

io_thread.h - IOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class. It initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and creates a new thread using pthread_create() function. The new thread executes the main() function of the IOThread class, passing the current object as a parameter.

After creating the new thread, the constructor waits for the new thread to finish executing the main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore semaphore. This semaphore is initially set to 0, so the call to sem_wait() blocks until the new thread signals it by calling sem_post() on the same semaphore. Once the semaphore is signaled, the constructor destroys the m_init_semaphore semaphore and returns.

In summary, the IOThread() method is used to create a new thread and wait for it to finish initializing before returning.

io_thread.h - getIOThread()
The getIOThread() method returns a pointer to an instance of the IOThread class. When the IOThread() constructor is called, it initializes two semaphores, creates a new thread using pthread_create(), and waits for the new thread to finish executing the IOThread::main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore. Once the new thread has finished executing IOThread::main(), it signals the m_init_semaphore using sem_post(), allowing the constructor to continue executing and eventually return the newly created IOThread instance. The m_init_semaphore is then destroyed using sem_destroy().

io_thread.h - ~IOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class, which is called when an instance of the class is created. It initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and creates a new thread using pthread_create() function, passing the IOThread::main() function as the thread function and the current object (this) as the argument.

After creating the thread, the constructor waits for the new thread to finish executing the IOThread::main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore semaphore. This semaphore is initially set to 0, so the call to sem_wait() blocks the constructor until the semaphore is signaled by the new thread. Once the semaphore is signaled, the constructor destroys the m_init_semaphore semaphore and returns.

The ~IOThread() method is the destructor of the IOThread class, which is called when an instance of the class is destroyed. It does not use the IOThread() method directly, but it may indirectly call it if the instance being destroyed was created using the IOThread() constructor. The destructor does not need to wait for the new thread to finish executing, as it assumes that the thread has already completed its work and has been joined using pthread_join() or detached using pthread_detach(). Therefore, the destructor does not need to use the m_init_semaphore semaphore or any other synchronization mechanism.

io_thread.h - GetCurrentIOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class. When a new IOThread object is created, it initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and creates a new thread using pthread_create() function. The new thread executes the static method IOThread::main() with the current IOThread object as its argument.

After creating the new thread, the constructor waits for the new thread to finish executing IOThread::main() method by calling sem_wait() function on m_init_semaphore. This semaphore is signaled by the new thread when it finishes executing IOThread::main() method. Once the semaphore is signaled, the constructor destroys the m_init_semaphore and returns.

The GetCurrentIOThread() method is a static method that returns a pointer to the current IOThread object. It does not create a new IOThread object, but instead, it returns the IOThread object associated with the current thread. This is achieved by calling pthread_getspecific() function with a key that is unique to the IOThread class. If the IOThread object is not yet associated with the current thread, GetCurrentIOThread() creates a new IOThread object and associates it with the current thread using pthread_setspecific() function.

tcp_connection.h - TcpConnection(tinyrpc::TcpServer *, tinyrpc::IOThread *, int, int, NetAddress::ptr)
The IOThread() method is used to create a new thread for handling I/O operations. The TcpConnection() constructor takes in a pointer to a TcpServer object, a pointer to an IOThread object, a file descriptor, a buffer size, and a NetAddress object.

The IOThread object is created by calling its constructor, which initializes two semaphores and creates a new thread using pthread_create(). The new thread executes the IOThread::main() method, which performs the actual I/O operations.

After creating the new thread, the TcpConnection constructor waits for it to finish initializing by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore semaphore. Once the semaphore is signaled by the new thread, the constructor continues executing and the IOThread object is ready to handle I/O operations for the TcpConnection object.

Overall, the IOThread() method is used to create a separate thread for handling I/O operations, which allows the main thread to continue executing other tasks without being blocked by I/O operations.

tcp_server.cc - MainAcceptCorFunc()
The IOThread() method is used by MainAcceptCorFunc() to create a new IO thread and add a new client to it. When a new client is accepted by the TcpServer, MainAcceptCorFunc() calls addClient() to add the client to an IO thread. The IO thread is obtained from the IO thread pool using the getIOThread() method.

Once an IO thread is obtained, a new TcpConnection object is created for the client and initialized as a server connection. The TcpConnection object is then added to the IO thread's reactor using addCoroutine(). Finally, the TCP connection count is incremented.

The IOThread() method creates a new IO thread by calling pthread_create() and passing in the IOThread::main() method as the thread function. The IOThread() method also initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and waits for the new thread to finish initializing by calling sem_wait() on m_init_semaphore. Once the new thread has finished initializing, the semaphore is destroyed and the IOThread() method returns.

tinypb_rpc_async_channel.h - getIOThread()
The getIOThread() method returns a pointer to an instance of the IOThread class. When the IOThread() constructor is called, it initializes two semaphores, creates a new thread using pthread_create(), and waits for the new thread to finish executing the IOThread::main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore. Once the new thread has finished executing IOThread::main(), it signals the m_init_semaphore using sem_post(), allowing the constructor to continue executing and eventually return the newly created IOThread instance. The m_init_semaphore is then destroyed using sem_destroy().

tcp_server.cc - addClient(IOThread *, int)
The IOThread() method is used to create a new thread that will handle I/O operations for a TcpConnection. The addClient(IOThread *, int) method is called when a new client connects to the server, and it needs to create a new TcpConnection object for that client.

The IOThread() method initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and then creates a new thread using pthread_create(). The new thread will execute the static method IOThread::main(), passing in a pointer to the IOThread object as an argument.

The main() method of the new thread will block on the m_start_semaphore until it is signaled by the IOThread object. Once signaled, the main() method will enter a loop that waits for I/O events using epoll_wait(). When an event occurs, it will be handled by calling the appropriate method on the corresponding TcpConnection object.

When addClient(IOThread *, int) is called, it checks if a TcpConnection object already exists for the given file descriptor (fd). If it does, the existing object is reset and returned. If not, a new TcpConnection object is created and added to the m_clients map, and then returned. The IOThread object passed in as an argument is used to associate the new TcpConnection object with the correct I/O thread.

io_thread.h - IOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class. It initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and creates a new thread using pthread_create() function. The new thread executes the main() function of the IOThread class, passing the current object as a parameter.

After creating the new thread, the constructor waits for the new thread to finish executing the main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore semaphore. This semaphore is initially set to 0, so the call to sem_wait() blocks until the new thread signals it by calling sem_post() on the same semaphore. Once the semaphore is signaled, the constructor destroys the m_init_semaphore semaphore and returns.

In summary, the IOThread() method is used to create a new thread and wait for it to finish initializing before returning.

io_thread.h - ~IOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class, which initializes the m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore semaphores, creates a new thread using pthread_create(), and waits for the new thread to finish executing the main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore semaphore. Once the new thread has finished executing main(), it signals the m_init_semaphore semaphore using sem_post(), allowing the constructor to continue executing and eventually destroy the m_init_semaphore semaphore using sem_destroy().

The ~IOThread() method is the destructor of the IOThread class, which is called when an IOThread object is destroyed. It does not directly use the IOThread() method, but it may indirectly use it if an IOThread object is created and destroyed within the scope of a function. In that case, the IOThread() method would be called to create the new thread, and the ~IOThread() method would be called to destroy the thread and any associated resources.

io_thread.h - getIOThread()
The getIOThread() method returns a pointer to an instance of the IOThread class. When the IOThread() constructor is called, it initializes two semaphores, creates a new thread using pthread_create(), and waits for the new thread to finish executing the main() function using sem_wait(). Once the new thread has finished executing main(), it signals the m_init_semaphore, allowing the constructor to continue executing and return the newly created IOThread instance. Finally, the m_init_semaphore is destroyed. Therefore, getIOThread() returns a pointer to a fully initialized IOThread instance that is ready to be used for input/output operations.

io_thread.h - GetCurrentIOThread()
The IOThread() method is the constructor of the IOThread class. When a new IOThread object is created, it initializes two semaphores, m_init_semaphore and m_start_semaphore, and creates a new thread using pthread_create() function. The new thread executes the static method IOThread::main() with the current IOThread object as its argument.

After creating the new thread, the constructor waits for the new thread to finish executing IOThread::main() method by calling sem_wait() function on m_init_semaphore. This semaphore is signaled by the new thread when it finishes executing IOThread::main() method. Once the semaphore is signaled, the constructor destroys the m_init_semaphore and returns.

The GetCurrentIOThread() method is a static method that returns a pointer to the current IOThread object. It does not create a new IOThread object, but instead, it returns the IOThread object associated with the current thread. This is achieved by calling pthread_getspecific() function with a key that is unique to the IOThread class. If the IOThread object is not yet associated with the current thread, GetCurrentIOThread() creates a new IOThread object and associates it with the current thread using pthread_setspecific() function.

The IOThread object is used to create a new thread that will handle the I/O operations for the TcpConnection object.

Inside the IOThread() method, two semaphores are initialized and a new thread is created using pthread_create(). The main function is passed as a parameter to pthread_create() along with the current object (this). The main function is a static method that will be executed by the new thread.

After the new thread is created, the current thread waits for the new thread to finish executing the main function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore. Once the new thread has finished executing the main function, it signals the m_init_semaphore and the current thread continues executing. The m_init_semaphore is then destroyed.

Overall, the IOThread() method is used to create a new thread that will handle the I/O operations for a TcpConnection object. The new thread is created using pthread_create() and the main function is passed as a parameter along with the current object. The current thread waits for the new thread to finish executing the main function before continuing.

tinypb_rpc_async_channel.h - getIOThread()
The getIOThread() method returns a pointer to an instance of the IOThread class. When the IOThread() constructor is called, it initializes two semaphores, creates a new thread using pthread_create(), and waits for the new thread to finish executing the IOThread::main() function by calling sem_wait() on the m_init_semaphore. Once the new thread has finished executing IOThread::main(), it signals the m_init_semaphore using sem_post(), allowing the constructor to continue executing and eventually return the newly created IOThread instance. The m_init_semaphore is then destroyed using sem_destroy().

tcp_server.h - addClient(IOThread *, int)
The IOThread() method is used to create a new thread that will handle I/O operations for a client connection.

It then calls the addClient() method of the TcpConnection class, passing in the IOThread pointer and fd. The addClient() method of TcpConnection creates a new TcpConnection object and adds it to the IOThread's list of connections to handle. The IOThread's main() method is responsible for handling I/O operations for all the connections in its list.

In the IOThread() method, two semaphores are initialized and the new thread is created using pthread_create(). The main() method of the IOThread is passed as the function to be executed by the new thread. The main() method waits for the new thread to finish initializing by waiting on the m_init_semaphore using sem_wait(). Once the new thread has finished initializing, it signals the m_init_semaphore using sem_post() and the main() method continues execution. The m_init_semaphore is then destroyed using sem_destroy().

The getStartSemaphore() function, on the other hand, is a global function that can be called from any part of the program. It uses the getStartSemaphore() method to obtain a pointer to the start semaphore of the IOThread object that is currently executing. This pointer can then be used to synchronize the execution of the current IOThread object with other threads in the system.

tcp_server.cc - MainAcceptCorFunc()
The getReactor() method is used by MainAcceptCorFunc() to obtain the Reactor object associated with the IOThread. This Reactor object is then used to add the coroutine associated with the newly accepted TcpConnection.
